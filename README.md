### Building Segmentation Using Satellite Imagery

This project is a web-based application designed to perform building segmentation on satellite images. It provides a simple, intuitive interface built with Streamlit, allowing any user to easily upload an image and receive a processed output that highlights detected buildings. The application serves as a practical demonstration of deep learning in a real-world computer vision task.

#### Core Functionality

The application's workflow is straightforward and user-friendly. When you upload a satellite image, the app's backend processes it through a pre-trained deep learning model. The original image and the segmented result are then displayed side-by-side for a clear comparison. The segmented image features a semi-transparent red overlay that visually marks the areas identified by the model as buildings. The main components include:

- A Streamlit front-end for the user interface.
- An image uploader that accepts common image formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG).
- A button to initiate the segmentation process.
- Logic to display the original image and the final processed image with the building overlay.

This design ensures that the entire process, from image input to output visualization, is seamless and requires no technical expertise from the user.


#### The U-Net Segmentation Model

The heart of this project is a **U-Net convolutional neural network**, a deep learning architecture particularly well-suited for image segmentation. The U-Net model is known for its ability to produce highly precise segmentation masks by retaining spatial information throughout its network structure. It was trained on a large dataset of satellite imagery to learn the features of buildings, such as shapes, textures, and patterns, enabling it to distinguish them from other elements like roads, vegetation, and water bodies.


#### A Discussion on Model Performance and Accuracy

During training, the model achieved a mean accuracy of approximately 91%, which may seem quite high. However, it's crucial to understand why this metric can be misleading in a segmentation context. Accuracy is a measure of correctly classified pixels out of the total number of pixels in an image. In most satellite images, the majority of the pixels represent the background (e.g., ground, trees, roads), while buildings occupy a relatively small area.

Consequently, a model can achieve a high accuracy score simply by correctly classifying the numerous background pixels, even if it completely fails to identify any of the building pixels. This phenomenon is a classic example of an imbalanced dataset problem.

A more reliable measure of performance for this type of task is the **Jaccard index**, also known as **Intersection over Union (IoU)**, which directly assesses the overlap between the predicted buildings and the actual buildings in the image. Although the model exhibits a high accuracy, its performance on actual building segmentation, as shown in the output, is limited. This is due to the inherent challenge of learning to distinguish building features with high precision when they constitute such a small fraction of the total data.

#### Future Improvements

To enhance the model's segmentation capabilities, several avenues for improvement exist:

1.  Metric and Loss Function Optimization: Replacing accuracy with IoU or the Dice coefficient as the primary evaluation metric during training would provide a truer reflection of the model's performance on the segmentation task. Similarly, utilizing a loss function like the Dice loss would encourage the model to focus on correctly segmenting the buildings, rather than just the background.
2.  Dataset Expansion and Augmentation: Training the model on a more diverse and larger dataset could help it generalize better to new environments and building types. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, and color shifts could also be applied to create more varied training examples.
3.  Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, could lead to better learning and improved segmentation results.
